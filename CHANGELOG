  -----------------[ experimental ] -----------------
  * util/crack: Fix python3 --crack crash

     "Wifite would crash if run with python3 and the parameter --crack
      if a dependency was missing, just after selecting a target.
      This was caused by popping from a dictionary while iterating on
      it, an operation forbidden in python3."

  * model/handshake: Handshake detection for aircrack-ng 1.5.x

  * Fix python3 crash in "cracking" session
  * Updated Dockerfile
