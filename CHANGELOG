  * util/crack: Fix python3 --crack crash

     "Wifite would crash if run with python3 and the parameter --crack
      if a dependency was missing, just after selecting a target.
      This was caused by popping from a dictionary while iterating on
      it, an operation forbidden in python3."

  * args.py: Select multiple scan channels

     "Remove the integer restriction for selecting a channel.
      Doing so we pass the argument from wifite directly to airodump which does support the format -c 1,3-7,11-13.

      Added a regex check for validity because airodump would crash if an invalid channel argument would be sent."

  * `--infinite/-inf` argument activates the infinite attack mode.
    In this attack mode Wifite will enter a scan for <scan_time>
    and after that timer expires it will attack all nearby targets
    Infinite attack mode will respect all target and attack
    restrictions (-E, -b, --pmkid, etc.)

  * `scan_time` is configurable by using the pillage (-p) parameter

  * Stop the attack by sending SIGINT(Ctrl+C) while scanning for
    targets. The user will be prompted to choose between starting
    attacking targets or exit.

  * Added NULL PIN attack (WPS NULL PIN)
  * Added show manufacturers/OUIs option "--showm"
  * Added "--no-pmkid" option to skip PMKID attack
  * Added target PMKID check with aircrack-ng
  * model/handshake: Handshake detection for aircrack-ng 1.5.x
  * Fix python3 crash in "cracking" session
  * Added option to select "--reaver" as default WPS tool. We've already got "--bully".
  * Added "--deamon" mode
  * Added "--power" option.
    Only display and attack APs that had at least <power> during the current scan.

  * Migrated from "iwconfig" to "iw" due to deprecation of iwconfig
  * Standard wordlist contains more passwords then the previous wordlist
  * Targeted attack make -e ESSID case sensitive
  * Ignore multiple ESSIDs with -E
  * Added a few more vendors to ieee-oui.txt
  * Removed unnecessary imports (from dependency.py)
  * Save checked-for-existance commands inside a list to not check them over and over again (avoid logspam)
  * Removed hashcat dependency for PMKID capture
  * Simplified boolean var checks
  * Improved bounds check in wifite/attack/wep.py
  * Print more helpful airodumo traceback/debug
  * Improved colors and output around the code (some minors)
  * Run 'runtests.sh' in Python3 instead of Python2.7
  * Updated Dockerfile
